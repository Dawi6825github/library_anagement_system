Challenge: Develop a Simple Library Management System with Custom API Using Frappe Framework
Create a basic library management system with a custom API using the Frappe framework. This system will manage books, members, and loans in a library. The goal is to assess your ability to build a full-stack application with Frappe and demonstrate your understanding of API development, integration, and front-end implementation capability.
Core Features:
Book Management:
Create a DocType Book with fields like Title, Author, Publish Date, and ISBN.
Implement CRUD operations for books.
Membership Management:
Create a DocType Member with fields like Name, Membership ID, Email, and Phone Number.
Implement CRUD operations for members.
Loan Management:
Create a DocType Loan for tracking book loans.
Include Member, Book, Loan Date, and Return Date fields.
Add functionality to check the availability of books for loan.
User Interface:
Develop flexible forms for data entry and display.
Include necessary validation checks.
Reports:
Create a report for all currently loaned books.
Generate a report for overdue books.
Custom API Development:
Develop a REST API that allows external applications to interact with your library system.
The API should support operations like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting books and members.
Ensure the API includes authentication to secure access.
Front End:
Develop a user login interface that requires users to log in using their email/username and password.
Once logged in, provide an interface to:
Display a list of available library books.
Show details of each book.
Allow users to loan a book.
Advanced Features:
Automated email reminders for overdue books.
Feature for members to reserve books.
User authentication and roles management (admin, librarian, member).
Setup and Demonstration:
The application must be developed using the Frappe Framework.
Your code should be clean, well-commented, and adhere to best practices.
Create and publish your custom Frappe App code to a public GitHub repo with a README file with instructions for setting up and running the application. Do not publish the entire Frappe Framework or other apps.
You have two options for the demo setup:
A. Deploy your application on a free hosting service and provide the URL.
B. Set up the application on your laptop for an in-office demonstration.
Evaluation Criteria:
Functionality and implementation of required features.
Quality and organization of the code.
Effectiveness of the custom API.
UI design and ease of use.
Adherence to Frappe framework standards and best practices.
Next Steps:
Once your application is ready, call our office for a live demonstration.
