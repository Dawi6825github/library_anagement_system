Library Management System with Custom API Using Express.js
Challenge Overview
This project involves developing a Library Management System with a custom API using Express.js. The system will manage books, members, and loans in a library. The objective is to assess your ability to build a full-stack application with Express.js and demonstrate your knowledge of API development, integration, and front-end implementation.

Core Features
1. Book Management
Create a Book model with fields such as:
Title
Author
Publish Date
ISBN
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for books using Express.js and a database of your choice (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).
2. Membership Management
Create a Member model with fields such as:
Name
Membership ID
Email
Phone Number
Implement CRUD operations for managing members.
3. Loan Management
Create a Loan model to track book loans with fields for:
Member
Book
Loan Date
Return Date
Implement functionality to check book availability before issuing a loan.
4. User Interface
Develop interactive forms for data entry and display.
Include validation checks to ensure data integrity and consistency.
5. Reports
Generate reports for:
Currently loaned books.
Overdue books based on loan dates.
6. Custom API Development
Develop a REST API with Express.js to allow external applications to interact with your library system.
The API should support:
Adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting books and members.
Checking book availability and loan status.
Implement JWT authentication to secure API access.
7. Front-End Implementation
Develop a user login interface that requires email/username and password.
Once logged in, users should be able to:
View a list of available library books.
View details of each book.
Loan a book through the system.
8. Advanced Features
Automated email reminders for overdue books.
Book reservation feature for members.
Role-based authentication (Admin, Librarian, Member).
Setup and Demonstration
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your system.
A database of your choice (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).
Steps to Set Up
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Set up the database:

Create a database of your choice (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).
Update the database connection settings in the .env file (create this file if not already present).
Start the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The API should now be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Demo Setup Options
You have two options to present your project:

Option A: Deploy your application on a free hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Render, or Heroku) and provide the URL for access.

Option B: Set up the application on your local machine for an in-office demonstration.

Evaluation Criteria
Functionality: Completeness of required features and whether they work as expected.
Code Quality: Clean, well-commented code following best practices.
API Effectiveness: Performance, security, and usability of the API.
UI Design: Usability and ease of navigation.
Adherence to Best Practices: Express.js development standards and project organization.
Next Steps
Once your application is ready, contact me to schedule a live demonstration. We look forward to seeing your work!
