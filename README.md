Challenge: Develop a Simple Library Management System with Custom API Using Express.js
Create a basic library management system with a custom API using Express.js. This system will manage books, members, and loans in a library. The goal is to assess your ability to build a full-stack application with Express.js and demonstrate your understanding of API development, integration, and front-end implementation capabilities.

Core Features
Book Management
Create a Book model with fields like Title, Author, Publish Date, and ISBN.
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for books using Express.js and a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).
Membership Management
Create a Member model with fields like Name, Membership ID, Email, and Phone Number.
Implement CRUD operations for managing members.
Loan Management
Create a Loan model to track book loans.
Include fields for Member, Book, Loan Date, and Return Date.
Implement functionality to check book availability before issuing a loan.
User Interface
Develop interactive forms for data entry and display.
Include validation checks to ensure data integrity.
Reports
Generate a report of all currently loaned books.
Create a report for overdue books based on loan dates.
Custom API Development
Develop a REST API using Express.js to allow external applications to interact with the library system.
The API should support:
Adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting books and members.
Checking book availability and loan status.
Implement JWT authentication to secure access to the API.
Front-End Implementation
Develop a user login interface requiring users to log in using their email/username and password.
Once logged in, users should be able to:
View a list of available library books.
View details of each book.
Loan a book through the system.
Advanced Features
Automated email reminders for overdue books.
Book reservation feature for members.
Role-based authentication (Admin, Librarian, Member).
Setup and Demonstration
The application must be developed using Express.js, Node.js, and a database of your choice (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).
Your code should be clean, well-commented, and follow best practices.
Publish your Express.js project to a public GitHub repository with a README file containing setup instructions.
Do not include unnecessary dependencies or environment files in the repo.
Demo Setup Options
You have two options to present your project:
A. Deploy your application on a free hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Render, or Heroku) and provide the URL.
B. Set up the application on your local machine for an in-office demonstration.

Evaluation Criteria
Functionality and completeness of required features.
Code quality and project organization.
Effectiveness of the API (performance, security, and usability).
UI design and ease of navigation.
Adherence to best practices in Express.js development.
Next Steps
